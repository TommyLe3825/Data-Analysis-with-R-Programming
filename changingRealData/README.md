# title: "Lesson 3: Changing your data"

## Background for this activity
In this activity, youâ€™ll review a scenario, and focus on manipulating and changing real data in R. You will learn more about functions you can use to manipulate your data, use statistical summaries to explore your data, and gain initial insights for your stakeholders. 

Throughout this activity, you will also have the opportunity to practice writing your own code by making changes to the code chunks yourself. If you encounter an error or get stuck, you can always check the Lesson3_Change_Solutions .rmd file in the Solutions folder under Week 3 for the complete, correct code. 

## The Scenario
In this scenario, you are a junior data analyst working for a hotel booking company. You have been asked to clean a .csv file that was created after querying a database to combine two different tables from different hotels. You have already performed some basic cleaning functions on this data; this activity will focus on using functions to conduct basic data manipulation.
