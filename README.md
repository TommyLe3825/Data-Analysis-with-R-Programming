# Data-Analysis-with-R-Programming
- This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and projects based on the [Data Analysis with R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/home/module/1) on Coursera from Google. 
- The course materials, including problem descriptions and examples, are owned by Google and Coursera. These solutions are for educational and reference purposes only. If you're interested in learning R, I highly recommend taking the course on Coursera.
